## UI standards
- Next.js scaffold (JavaScript or TypeScript accepted unless the repo migrates to TS-only).
- Do not embed secrets in client code.
- Prefer server-side API calls to the backend API; avoid direct bus access.
- UI must clearly label if any external AI processing is enabled (disabled by default).
